* `pod:restarts:high` to detects pods with unusual number of restarts.

### ADDED - New pages to the docs
* The [Prometheus doc](https://docs.hamravesh.com/darkube/databases/prometheus/)
* The [RabbitMQ doc](https://docs.hamravesh.com/darkube/apps/rabbitmq/)
* Added details on how to use the new config tab for eligible one-click apps.
