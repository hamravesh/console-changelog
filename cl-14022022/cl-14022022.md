### ADDED - A new monitoring service
Through a one-click activation, you can create an isolated Prometheus datasource containing
metrics across your organization namespaces. You can also swiftly deploy a 
[Grafana instance](https://docs.hamravesh.com/darkube/apps/grafana/) to explore your
metrics and visualize them using dashboards. To setup your monitoring cycle and find out more, view 
[the docs](https://docs.hamravesh.com/monitoring/introduction/).

### ADDED - A new HPA feature for stateless apps
A new HPA tab in the app detail page allows you to configure a dynamic scale up or down of 
your stateless pods between a minimum and maximum number of replicas if CPU consumption 
consistently exceeds or drops bellow a specific threshold. Find out more 
[here](https://docs.hamravesh.com/darkube/hpa/).

### ADDED - A one-click MsSQL database
Find out more [here](https://docs.hamravesh.com/darkube/databases/mssql/).

### ADDED - An alert for CPU throttling
In cases where a pod consistently experiences significant CPU throttling for a few short minutes,
you will be notified in the alerts section. These cases indicate a shortage in CPU (and or memory) resources.

### ADDED - New pages to the docs
* The [Monitoring doc](https://docs.hamravesh.com/monitoring/introduction/)
* The [MsSQL doc](https://docs.hamravesh.com/darkube/databases/mssql/)
* The [HPA doc](https://docs.hamravesh.com/darkube/hpa/)

### Smaller improvements and fixes
* #### ADDED - Increased Confluence session timeout from 30 minutes to 14 days for ease of use.
* #### ADDED - A pending state to the pod status section in the app list page.
